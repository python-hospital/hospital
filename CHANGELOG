0.10 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.9 (2014-11-19)
----------------

Bugfixes around CLI and WSGI.

- Bug #73: hospital-cli exits with code 0 on success, 1 in case of failure (was
  always returning 0, even if some healthchecks reported errors).
  
- Bug #78: hospital-wsgi supports unittest's "skip" feature (was raising
  errors).

- Refactoring #80: updated some links in documentation (permanent redirects).


0.8.1 (2014-10-28)
------------------

Fixing some URLs in documentation.

- Bug #76: fixed some broken links in documentation (milestones, pytest
  markers). Checking documentation links as part of Sphinx tests.


0.8 (2014-05-05)
----------------

Integration with pytest and support for Python 3.4.

- Feature #50: pytest can collect and run healthchecks.

- Feature #65: added support for Python 3.4.

- Refactoring #62: moved tests outside distribution, i.e. ``hospital.tests``
  is no longer available. Tests now live in hospital's repository only.

- Refactoring #59: removed nose and rednose from sphinx requirements in
  tox.ini.

- Refactoring #58: removed useless ``all`` target in Makefile.


0.7 (2014-04-15)
----------------

Bugfixes.

- Bug #52: fixed test discovery in packages and modules located outside working
  directory. Was raising exceptions such as `AssertionError: Path must be
  within the project` and `ValueError: Attempted relative import in
  non-package`.

- Feature #54: README (and documentation index) shows a simple example.

- Bug #51: documentation footer now mentions "BSD license" next to the
  copyright. Was missing, readers could believe the project is not open source.


0.6 (2014-03-07)
----------------

Improvements around CLI and WSGI features.

- Feature #44: hospital.wsgi.application is a WSGI endpoint. Added
  documentation about running healthcheck service with Gunicorn, Chaussette,
  Circus, and Django via twod.wsgi.

- Feature #47: ``hospital-cli`` and ``hospital-serve`` commands are a
  convenient way to use ``hospital.cli`` and ``hospital.wsgi``.


0.5 (2014-02-28)
----------------

Introduced CLI and WSGI. They offer basic features (with experimental
implementation), but they should be enough as proof of concepts.

- Feature #39: ``python -m hospital.cli`` collects and runs healthchecks.

- Feature #20: ``python -m hospital.wsgi`` runs a web server that collects
  and runs healthchecks on HTTP GET.


0.4 (2014-02-25)
----------------

Improvements around output of builtin assertions.

- Feature #33: builtin assertions functions accept optional ``msg`` argument.

- Bugfix #31: when ``assert_http_response()`` fails, it provides comprehensive
  message (was "AssertionError" without details about URL and reason).


0.3 (2014-02-09)
----------------

Documentation review and development environment refactoring: let's try to
simplify usage and development of `hospital`.

- Feature #25: the Makefile in project's repository no longer creates a
  virtualenv. Developers setup the environment as they like, i.e. using
  virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper or whatever. Added documentation about the
  Makefile scope and usage.

- Feature #19: reviewed contributor guide, added branching policy.

- Feature #24: added note about project's status in documentation.

- Feature #21: reviewed API documentation.

- Bugfix #18: README can be rendered as HTML with `docutils`' ``rst2html.py``.
  Fixes PyPI information page.


0.2 (2013-12-27)
----------------

Documentation review, API refactoring, addition of some assertions.

- Feature #17: introduced ``assert_http_response`` assertion.

- Feature #16: introduced ``assert_supported_python_version`` assertion.

- Feature #15: exposed API at root of ``hospital`` package. Items not exposed
  in this root API may be moved without notice, whereas root API is tested and
  refactoring will be documented. 

- Feature #14: introduced ``healthcheck`` decorator. Deprecates former
  ``HealtCheck`` base class (not removed in this version).
