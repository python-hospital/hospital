Write healthchecks
##################

Health checks are special kind of tests. So you can write health checks just
like you would write tests, except you use :func:`~hospital.core.healthcheck`
decorator to differenciate health checks from tests.

Of course, you will not check the same things in tests and in healthchecks.
The main difference is the scope: healthchecks validate "production" stuff
whereas tests use mocks/fakes/dummies. See also :doc:`/about/lexicon`.
 

*******************
Assert expectations
*******************

Just like tests, health checks can be simple functions that perform assertions:

.. code:: python

   import sys
   import hospital

   @hospital.healthcheck
   def test_python_version():
       """Python version >= 2."""
       assert sys.version_info[0] >= 2

You can reuse test libraries, like :mod:`unittest`:

.. code:: python

   import unittest
   import hospital

   @hospital.healthcheck
   class DocumentationHealthCheck(unittest.TestCase):
       """Check `hospital` online documentation."""
       def test_ping(self):
           """`hospital` documentation server responds to ping."""
           hostname = 'hospital.readthedocs.org'
           hospital.assert_ping(hostname)

       def test_http_200(self):
           """`hospital` online documentation returns HTTP 200."""
           url = 'http://hospital.readthedocs.org/en/0.1/'
	   hospital.assert_http_response(url, status_code=200)

`Hospital` provides a set of useful :doc:`/api/assertions` and :doc:`health
check suites </api/healthchecks>`.


***********************************
Recommended namespace: healthchecks
***********************************

As a convention, put healthchecks in "healthchecks" namespace (i.e. module or
package) inside your projects.

Just as "tests" namespace is used by convention for tests.

As an example, if your project distributes an "unbreakable" root package, then
you should put healthchecks in either :file:`unbreakable/healthchecks.py`
module or :file:`unbreakable/healthchecks/` package.


********************
What should I check?
********************

Just like tests, one big question is: what should I check? Here are some tips:

Check external resources and services
=====================================

Does your application depends on third-party services? You should check their
availability, and when possible their version.

Check configuration
===================

Often, you can guess the things to check by looking at your configuration. As
an example, URL of external services are usually mentioned in configuration.
In configuration, you may find more items to check, including internal
resources.

Check environment
=================

With tests (unit, functional, integration...), you make sure your application
has the desired behaviour in known situations. With healthchecks, you can
assert the runtime environment (production) matches these known situations.

As an example, you may want to assert your application uses known good versions
of Python and dependencies. Or you may want to assert the user running your
application can read (or write) some filesystem locations...
